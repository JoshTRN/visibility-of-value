There is a superstition of modernity which declares that nature contains no properties that are not countenanced by the natural sciences. By “superstition” I mean: no one knows how and when this was proved nor has anyone shown how it helps us to live better. On the presumption that natural science does not study values, i.e., properties described in value terms, the superstition has the effect of evacuating nature of all value properties. Values thus become entirely a matter of our invention, reducible to or derivable in some sense entirely from our own states of mind—as David Hume and Adam Smith would have it, from our “desires” and “moral sentiments”—not properties in the world we inhabit and to which our desires and moral sentiments are responses. This is one sense in which we may speak of the invisibility, or better, the <i>making invisible</i> of values by a dogmatic equation of the last few centuries, the comprehensive equation of the very concept of nature with the domain studied by the natural sciences. (This is, in fact, a first step to a further transformation that has had disastrous practical effects on the environment and on human life: the equation of the idea of nature with the idea of natural resources—though I will not get to that second step and further transformation in this brief paper.)<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> Some years ago I was asked to speak at a conference in Berlin on the then relatively unmined but now very fashionable subject of the “Anthropocene.” Each speaker was asked to bring to the conference an object and to speak on its significance for our understanding of nature. There was an array of objects on tables and on the walls as the conference proceeded. What, I was asked, was the object that I would base my lecture on? I had brought no object of that kind and had nothing to display, and I replied that the object I would speak on would be: “a threat.” That this should have caused any surprise at all is just a symptom of the superstition that I began with, an assumption of the zeitgeist that a threat—a thing described in value terms— cannot be an object.
</p>

<p>
Think, then, of the fisherman on the coastline of Bangladesh. On his visible horizon, we are allowed to say, there is something, some phenomenon that he sees, which can be described in elaborate meteorological terms. But it seems the most natural thing in the world for us to say that, over and above such descriptions, what he sees is a threat to himself and his family, to his thatched dwelling. Literally sees a threat? Yes! We see dark clouds there, we see lightning there, but where do we see the threat? At the very places where we see the dark clouds and the lightning, at the very place where there are things that get meteorological descriptions, we see something that gets an evaluative description of being “a threat” to him, his family, his thatched dwelling. Of course, I could not arrange to bring this object, this threat, to the conference. People would have to travel to Bangladesh or to Florida or elsewhere to see it. But I could equally have said that in the right context the small boulder that another speaker had brought to the conference might be a threat. It is context that transforms objects or properties that may get nothing but descriptions of meteorology or geology or other sciences into such evaluatively described properties as “threats.” But that is quite generally true. <i>All</i> descriptions, whether scientific or evaluative, depend on context and cease to apply when the relevant context passes.
</p>

<p>
The making invisible of value properties by the superstition I am inveighing against is not restricted to nature. It carries over to social and moral phenomena as well. Take a wellnown example from the philosopher Gilbert Harman (1975): some kids in an alley are burning a cat. What is visible to someone driving by are the kids, the fire, the cat. But, if I am right to dismiss the superstition, right where the kids and the cat and the fire are visible there is visible a further property: cruelty. And natural science does not study cruelty, just as it does not study threats. It studies combustion and condensation, but not value properties, not things described in value terms such as cruelty and threats.
</p>

<p>
In the view favored by Hume and Smith, very much of a piece with the superstition I am discussing, all this talk of threats and cruelty as being visible properties of nature and the world is a confusion. It confuses or conflates our states of mind (the <i>feelings of vulnerability</i> of the fisherman who I am claiming sees a threat, the <i>moral sentiment of sympathy</i> of the driver who I am claiming sees the cruelty) with visible properties in nature and the world. The right thing to say, in their view, is that our states of mind, our vulnerabilities and sympathy, are being <i>projected</i> onto nature and the world as visible properties, but it is an illusion to think that real visible properties (threats, cruelty) are actually there to be seen.
</p>

<p>
Kant too, despite his famous opposition to Hume, refused to countenance the visibility of value. Taking for granted that Newton’s laws had comprehensive sway over all phenomena, value properties were not phenomenal properties. They had to be relegated to a noumenal realm of “pure practical” reason. So, despite the familiar disputes between Hume and Kant that have dominated modern moral thinking for so long, there was nevertheless a consensus between them, an acquiescence to the superstition that the visible or “phenomenal” (to use Kant’s own word) world contained no phenomena that did not fall within the purview of natural science.
</p>

<p>
The philosopher to whom we may attribute a quite different picture of values is apparently Aristotle, according to a recent, extremely interesting reading of him by John McDowell (1979). If McDowell is right, Aristotle would take within his stride a <i>perceptible</i> world of properties such as threats and cruelties, therefore a world not exhaustively purveyed by the natural sciences. But Aristotle was only a figure in the <i>high</i> philosophical tradition who did not subscribe to the superstition, and high philosophy is only a narrow strand of intellectual history—the superstition was not part of the worldview of a very wide variety of folk and spiritual traditions (including popular Christianity) for centuries before and after Aristotle.
</p>

<p>
These traditions, as we know, mostly viewed the source of perceptible value properties in the world to be sacred and conceived nature as being shot through with value <i>because</i> it was shot through with the presence of the divine. It was only after the desacralization of nature in the modern period that such a view of nature and the world began to be seen as what came to be called “enthusiasm,” a pejorative term for a doctrine that made God democratically available (it was <i>“popular”</i> religion after all) to the visionary temperaments of all who inhabited his earth, rather than a remote and distant providential God available only to the learned and scriptural judgment of university-trained divines. The link between the exile of God to this remote and providential place, and the superstition that nature contained no properties that natural science did not study, emerged only in the seventeenth century, first in explicit form by alliances formed in England between the Anglican establishment and the Newtonians of the Royal Society,<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> and then spreading to other parts of Europe.
</p>

<p>
I have—no doubt impertinently—turned the notion of superstition on its head. In our modernity we are supposed to think that it is a superstition to claim that nature contains things, visible things such as threats and cruelties, that the natural sciences cannot study, whereas I have claimed that it is the denial of this claim that is the superstition, a superstition of our modernity. With what right or argument is this impertinence permissible? I will give the argument in two forms, first a quick and negative form, an argument that denies that there is anything unscientific about the idea that nature contains properties or things that the natural sciences cannot study. And then second, I give a more patiently and positively developed philosophical argument for the conclusion that we would not so much be the human <i>agents</i> we are, we would not possess the <i>agency</i> that human beings possess, if values were entirely made up by us, reducible to or derivable entirely from our desires and other states of mind, rather than visible properties in the world, including nature.
</p>

<p>
So, first, the quick and negative argument: it is frequently and uncritically thought that to say that nature contains properties the natural sciences cannot study, that it is not the business of the natural sciences to study, is unscientific, a superstition of premodernity, of a period prior to what Weber described in terms of secularization and the “disenchanting of the world.”
</p>

<p>
Let’s then first ask: what could possibly be meant by the term “unscientific”? It can really only mean one thing. A proposition or thought is unscientific if it contradicts a proposition of some science. But if so, it cannot possibly be unscientific to say that nature contains properties that the natural sciences cannot study, since no science contains the proposition that natural sciences can, without remainder, study all the properties of nature. This last is simply not a proposition in any science. It is only a proposition that philosophers proclaim (if someone like Richard Dawkins proclaims it, he is doing so not as a scientist doing the important scientific work he has done, but in his own time while he is playing at being a philosopher) and, as Wittgenstein once said of some claim, it is “so absurd that only a philosopher could have made it.”<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Why, if it is so obviously not the case that it is unscientific to deny that natural science has full and exhaustive coverage of nature, does it seem so common a tendency to nevertheless dismiss it as unscientific? One possible answer to this question is that the tendency emerges as an illicit extrapolation from the processes of desacralization that Weber summarized with such terms as “secularization” and “disenchantment.” Disenchantment, ever since Weber, has over the centuries been described in two registers—the “death of God” and the “decline of magic.” Our subject, however, is <i>value</i>, things and properties such as threats and cruelties populating the visible world. And were it even so that we cannot, in our thoroughly modern mentality, accept sacred or magical sources of value properties in the world, it would be quite illicit to conclude from this that nature, therefore, cannot contain value properties at all. Why should all value have a ground in magic and the sacred? That is to say, why, even if the sacred and the magical is conceived as bath water by the modern mind, should the baby, the secularly described value properties such as “threats” and “cruelties,” be thrown out with it? That discarding of the latter with the former is the illicit extrapolation. It may be that the former is rightly discarded in our modernity as unscientific, but it is an elementary fallacy of extrapolation to discard the latter as well, on that basis. Though we find no compulsion to say anymore that value properties are grounded in magic or the sacred, someone, indeed even an atheist, which I confess to being, can (and in my view, should) recognize value properties as visible in the natural world.
</p>

<p>
Of course, these remarks do not show that we <i>must</i> see the world, including nature, as containing such value properties. As I said, these initial remarks are intended as merely negative, only dismissing the charge that there was something unscientific or superstitious about saying that the world contains such properties. I turn now to the more constructive argument, which establishes that we must view the world, including nature, as containing these visible value properties. If the argument I present achieves that conclusion, it will allow me the impertinence of then reversing the charge of superstition, claiming that it is a superstition of modernity to deny that such properties exist. This argument will turn on relating the very concept of value to the concept of human agency and, to do so, I will begin at some distance from the question immediately before us (about whether value properties populate the visible world around us) before returning to it.
</p>

<p>
Let me set up the link between value and agency by first considering an ambiguity we find in the following thought or proposition someone might think or say: “I will do <span class="underline">_</span>.” This could be interpreted in one of two ways:
</p>

<p>
<a id="orge7486d2"></a>
<a id="org15b41a0"></a>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org34619d5">
(1) I intend that I will ___.
(2) I predict that I will ___.
</pre>

<p>
These are radically different thoughts that can be expressed by the same words because <a href="#orge7486d2">(1)</a> and <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> harbor entirely different points of view or perspectives on oneself. When one predicts that one will do something, one takes a disengaged or detached point of view on oneself. One views oneself as an object rather than a subject. When one intends something, one takes an engaged perspective on oneself, seeing oneself as an agent. In <a href="#orge7486d2">(1)</a> both occurrences of “I” are the I of agency, but in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> only the first occurrence of “I” is the I of agency. In the second occurrence of “I” in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a>, the personal pronoun denotes an object. This is because the subject denoted by the first occurrence of “I” in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> views himself or herself in a purely disengaged and detached way.
</p>

<p>
One can have both these perspectives (engaged and detached) on oneself, but not at the same time. In other words, one cannot at the same time both intend and predict that one will do something. The one perspective crowds the other perspective out. Moreover, and more importantly, unless one had an engaged perspective on oneself, one would not be a practical agent. Or, to put it from the other side, <i>if one only had or if all one had was a detached or disengaged perspective on oneself (as exemplified in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a>)</i>, one would cease to be a practical agent. I have italicized this because it is a point of real significance to which I will return later.
</p>

<p>
Why do I use the term “practical” agent in making this significant point? Because, as I said, in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> the first occurrence of “I” is the I of agency. But in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> that agency is exercised in a purely theoretical way on oneself, explaining and predicting one’s behavior. Predicting and explaining are, of course, agentive acts, so there is no denying that one is an agent when one is viewing oneself with detachment and predicting what one will do. But one’s angle on oneself, being detached in this way, restricts one’s agency in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> to theoretical agency. It is only when one’s angle on oneself is engaged as in <a href="#orge7486d2">(1)</a> that one is a practical agent. That is why, were we only to possess the perspective present in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a>, we would not be practical agents, even if we were agents.
</p>

<p>
I have put this last qualification “even if we were agents” in this conditional and hesitant form because it is in fact highly implausible that we can possess agency <i>at all</i>, agency of <i>any</i> kind, if we possess no practical agency. The idea that we are agents who are only capable of detached observation and prediction and explanation but no practical agency whatever is very likely an incoherent idea, though I won’t be able to argue for that here. The point I do want to keep in focus for now, however, is the italicized point above—that we cannot really be agents in the practical sense at all if we only have a detached perspective on ourselves as in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a>.
</p>

<p>
So far, I have said that an elementary ambiguity in a certain thought or expression hides a deep philosophical distinction between two perspectives each of us can have <i>on oneself</i>. But this distinction of perspective (detached and engaged) is a perfectly general one and need not be restricted to the idea of a perspective on oneself—it should extend and apply quite naturally to the perspective we have <i>on the world</i>. In other words, <a href="#orge7486d2">(1)</a> and <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a>, which harbor two perspectives on oneself, should be extendable without strain to two perspectives that we have on the world, such that there is also a distinction between a detached perspective that we can have on the world and an engaged perspective on it.
</p>

<p>
In many of our ordinary observations we think of the world in a detached way quite informally (“That’s a square table,” “Here’s the tree in the quad,” “The water in the lake is cold,” “She is going to class”), but when we do natural science, that detached perspective takes its most regimented form, and we predict and explain the objects, properties, and events in the world, bringing them under laws and generalizations, moving to a vocabulary of molecules, chlorophyll, H2O, neurons, etc. This detached perspective, whether informal or systematic as in science, is simply an extension of <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> from a perspective on ourselves to a perspective on the world. Now, if that is what a detached perspective on the world is, what is it to have an <i>engaged</i> perspective <i>on the world</i>? Here one’s agency cannot be purely theoretical as it is when one views the world in a detached way—that is, as containing elements to be predicted and explained by bringing them under laws and generalizations. It would have to be practical agency. So, then, two questions arise. What is practical agency and what would the world have to contain (over and above the properties that are explained by theoretical agency exercised in the detached perspective on it) if we are to have that form of engaged rather than detached perspective on it?
</p>

<p>
It is here that the link between agency and value comes to view. If we are to be practical agents engaged with the world, the world must contain elements over and above the elements that natural science (with its detached perspective on it) studies. Unless we describe the world in value terms—as containing such things as threats and cruelty—we could not be engaged with it in the practical sense. Over and above the condensation (the approaching storm on the coastline) and the combustion (the burning cat) that are captured by the perspective in the extension of <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> onto the world, the world must contain value properties (visible threats and cruelties) to trigger the extension of the perspective of <a href="#orge7486d2">(1)</a> onto the world. Thus someone who sees the horizon of the Bangladeshi coast in detached, meteorological terms will have only the extension of the perspective in <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> on the world, while someone who sees it as a threat will have a quite different perspective on the world, an engaged one, perhaps prompting him to go to the local municipality to arrange for some form of protection, etc. So too, someone may go to Calcutta and view another person’s condition in detached terms of average daily caloric counts but then may also perceive that that person is in need. When he perceives the world from a perspective that describes it in value terms of this sort—needs—he will be prompted to practical agency—to give money to Oxfam, say.
</p>

<p>
These are mere examples of how we may take the same distinction as is found in <a href="#orge7486d2">(1)</a> and <a href="#org15b41a0">(2)</a> and extend it on to the world. And I have used the vocabulary of science (caloric counts, condensation, combustion, etc.) and evaluative vocabulary (needs, threats, cruelty, etc.) in formulating the examples to make it clear that the latter describes properties in the world that natural science does not study.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> If there is some point to this distinction, then the link between agency and value comes into view. We have a perspective on the world that is an engaged rather than a detached one only to the extent that the world contains value properties over and above the properties that natural science studies and that trigger the engaged rather than a detached perspective on it.
</p>

<p>
Starting with an ambiguity in a certain thought or proposition, I’ve teased out of it, in small steps that introduced the notion of agency, how natural it is to think that values are visible properties in the world. But to show that something is a natural thing to think is not yet to give an argument for it. It is only to show that one may think it without strain. Can we do better and present an argument for the conclusion that the world is populated by values over and above the properties that natural science studies?
</p>

<p>
One way to come to an argument toward such a conclusion might be to raise a challenge for it and answer the challenge. I have relied on the link between practical agency and value to make my claims thus far. It is only as or qua practical agents, i.e., as subjects capable of engagement rather than mere detachment in our perspective on the world, that we view the world as containing value properties. The challenge might, then, seek to disrupt this link, denying that in order to be agents of this sort we must see the <i>world</i> as suffused with values. Practical agency, it might be said, is a simpler phenomenon than I am presenting it. It is a matter merely of acting on our desires and other such states and mental dispositions (including the loftier form they take, our moral sentiments). I have the desire to help the poor; I give money to Oxfam. I feel fear and vulnerability; I appeal to the municipality. I feel a combination of sympathy and indignation; I get out of my car and stop the kids from burning the cat. And so on.
</p>

<p>
Values, in this view, are derivable from these desires and other states of mind, and our agency is merely acting on these desires and states of mind. There is no need to add the further complication I am adding, which is that the desires and other states of mind must be <i>responses to value properties in the world</i> in order for us to be agents. So, what I am insisting on is that desires are <i>not self-standing</i>. They are responses to something that prompts them; they are responses to value properties in the world. Desires <i>in</i> us are nothing if there are no desirabilities (and undesirabilities) or values (and disvalues) in the world as well. And our agency consists in the fact that these desirabilities or values in the world make normative demands on us that trigger our desires upon which we act, as (practical) agents. And the challenge that views desires as self-standing simply denies this, claiming instead that agency consists merely in acting on our desires and those desires do not answer to any <i>external</i> calling of desirabilities or values in the world.
</p>

<p>
Can our agency be adequately characterized in terms of desires viewed as self-standing in this way? This is a good challenge because the view of agency it offers as an alternative is simpler and, therefore, may seem to be more intuitive than the more complicated one I am insisting on. To answer it, let me introduce some more conceptual apparatus.
</p>

<p>
There is a curiosity that was first pointed out by Gareth Evans in an insightful passage in his book, <i>The Varieties of Reference</i> (1982). When we are asked, “Is it raining?” we tend to look out the window and respond. And (this is the curiosity), when we are asked, “Do you believe that it is raining?” we tend to do the same. We don’t scan our interiors to see if it contains the belief that it is raining. We simply look outside and respond. In short, we tend to do the same thing whether we are being asked about the world or about a state of mind such as a belief. Evans went on to draw very interesting conclusions from this curiosity, but I want to exploit the curiosity for my very specific theme in this paper. I think it is perfectly plausible to <i>extend</i> Evans’s insight about beliefs to desires as well. If we are asked, “Do you desire x?” we don’t, in the normal and routine case (we may in some unusual contexts, such as for instance on a psychoanalyst’s couch), scan our mental interiors to see if it contains the desire for x; we simply consider the <i>desirability</i> of x.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup> If this is right, if Evans’s point can be extended to desires in this way, the dependence of desires on desirabilities is prima facie established. But someone under the spell of the superstition that the world (including nature) contains no values or desirabilities may deny that what seems to be so, prima facie, is actually so. This denial would stubbornly maintain that when we are asked about whether we desire something, unlike what Evans said about beliefs, we simply do not and cannot look to desirabilities since there <i>are no</i> such things or properties. On this view, <i>facts</i> (such as that it is raining) may rightly be viewed as “believabilities” (to coin a term that is the analogue to what I have called “desirabilities”) and so Evans’s point is right about beliefs, but since there is no equivalent to facts in the case of desires, my extension of Evans’s point, which claims that there are desirabilities we look to, is unwarranted. Therefore, in responding to the Evansian question about whether we desire something, we must and do look into our minds to see if they contain the desires being asked about.
</p>

<p>
I won’t indulge the temptation I have here to say that this just begs the questions and denies without argument what I have concluded from my extension of Evans’s point, viz., that there is indeed a counterpart to facts in the case of desires, i.e., desirabilities. This would only result in each side to the dispute claiming that the other is begging the question. I was supposed to prove that there are value properties or desirabilities, it will be said, and I have only given an analogy with beliefs in extending Evans’s point; I have not given an argument. But something more specific can be said by way of argument to break this impasse.
</p>

<p>
Let us pretend for a moment that this objection is right. Suppose, therefore, we do always look into our minds in order to answer questions of the form, “Do you desire &#x2026;?” That would mean that we always step outside ourselves and look at ourselves from the outside in, as it were, before we respond. We look at ourselves as objects to be scanned for whether or not we possess the relevant desire. In other words, we take on the <i>detached</i> perspective on ourselves. And if there were no desirabilities, only desires in the self-standing sense, then our desires would <i>only and always</i> be available to us as such objects of self-observation. Our entire relation to our desires could only be one in which they are given to us or available to us as desired by us. They would not be given to us or available to us via the desirabilities we perceive since there are no desirabilities to be perceived. We have no other way of being with our desires and experiencing them except by way of observing them. It is here that the italicized claim of some pages ago strikes us with its relevance. That claim was: <i>if one only had or if all one had was a detached or disengaged perspective on oneself (as exemplified in [<a href="#org15b41a0">2</a>]) one would cease to be a practical agent</i>.
</p>

<p>
The challenge, therefore, can only be successful by depriving us of our practical agency. But we manifestly do possess practical agency. So, the self-standing view of desires that the challenge assumes can only be true by denying something else that is manifestly true of us, that we are practical agents. That is why I said that we could not so much as be agents in the practical sense (and I would argue, therefore, in any sense) if desires were self-standing rather than responses to external callings, responses to the normative demands on us that come from desirabilities or value properties in the world.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
Though the argument as I have presented it is complicated, the conclusion should be presentable in rather obvious terms. Consider what is the philosophically significant difference between my thinking or saying as an observation of myself, “x is desired by me” and my thinking or saying “x is desirable.” In the former thought (“x is desired by me”) the desire itself lacks motivational power for me <i>qua agent</i>. Even if the desire were to dispose me to act, that act would be something that <i>happens</i> to me. I would not <i>enact</i> it. It would be an <i>“act”</i> only by courtesy, as it were. It would not be an agentive intervention in the world. I would merely be the <i>carrier</i> of the intervention in the world. These are the effects on desire of the desire being only available to me as desired, as something that is the object of my gaze or observation (rather than via my perceiving some desirability). It is deadened or leadened in its <i>agentive</i> motivational power by being an object of a detached perspective on myself.
</p>

<p>
But now consider the latter thought (“x is desirable”). When I think that x is desirable, my desire, which is a response to that desirability of x, is not an object of my observation. Its being given to me, its availability to me, is indirect; it is not given to me as desired, but via my apprehension of a desirability. This is what makes possible that I have an agentive relationship with my desire, because this indirect way of being given to me allows the desire to have agentive motivational power. The crucial point, then, is that it is <i>only</i> when our desires are not directly given to us in our observation of ourselves, but rather are <i>indirectly</i> given to us via our direct observation of desirabilities in the world, that our desires have agentive motivational power. And without that motivational power, desires cannot be the basis of our agency, as the challenge claims. So the simpler view, the view that desires are self-standing and not responses to desirabilities or values, cannot make its way to accounting for the agency we manifestly possess.
</p>

<p>
I will admit that this argument for the claim that there are value properties in the world ties value properties to the possession of practical agency. It will not move a philosopher who is prepared to deny that we do possess such agency.<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup> In that sense the paper’s conclusion is modest. The argument has no efficacy against such a philosopher, and I have no argument against someone (an Alamo-style philosopher, prepared to bite all bullets) who denies that we are agents, except, I suppose, just to say, “Come off it.” These are just the limitations of philosophy. No argument is efficacious against all comers, what analytic philosophers like to call “knock-down arguments.” At best, one can say: If you don’t believe what my argument establishes (in this case, that the world, including nature, contains visible value properties that fall outside the purview of natural science), see how much else of what seems true you have to give up believing (in this case, that we are subjects who possess practical agency).
</p>

<p>
This paper is not the occasion to explore the wider implications of the meta-ethical claim I have tried to establish, that the world (including nature) contains value properties—implications for politics, political economy, and the vexed subject of the environment.<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup> Those implications are of the utmost significance and need patient working out, and yet the tradition of philosophy within whose idiom I have made the argument for the claim has shown little interest in relating meta-ethics to these wider subjects and issues.<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup> So I particularly regret not having the space to do so here. What I will try to do instead as I bring the paper to a close is address some more immediate and much narrower philosophical implications of the claim and respond to some sources of doubt about the claim.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps one immediate implication to be drawn is that ethics is, in one sense, primarily a <i>perceptual</i> discipline. I use the word “primarily” and mean it. I don’t mean to suggest that deliberative and reflective elements are not important in ethics. They certainly are. But their role <i>nests within</i> a more basic perceptual understanding in which our moral agency responds to the normative demands of the value properties we perceive (or fail to perceive, or misperceive) as we navigate the world we inhabit. One obvious (there are other, less obvious things to say) nesting of the deliberative in the perceptual owes to the fact that much of our perception of values is differential and even conflicting. Agents from different cultures or backgrounds may apprehend quite different normative demands in the very same perceptible situation; indeed, sometimes a single moral agent (thinking within different cognitive frames, for instance) may do so. When this happens, deliberation and reflection of the familiar sort (ranking, weighing, assessing rational support or lack of support among values) are needed to make choices or to resolve the conflicts. What follows from putting perception in a primary place on the subject of value, in this way, is that our states of mind, which as we saw are not self-standing, are, as a result, <i>at once</i> our conduits for <i>apprehending</i> the world <i>and motivating</i> our agentive responses to what is apprehended. That is to say, it is not as if one sort of state apprehends the value properties in the world via perception of it and another quite self-standing state motivates our actions on the world. Apprehension and motivation are not two radically separated directions by which we relate to the world, apprehension going from the world to us and motivation going from us to the world.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup> Rather, the very fact that it is something like <i>values</i> that we are perceiving in the world makes it clear that the perceptions themselves are motivating. It is not as if the perception of the threat in an impending storm and the feelings of vulnerability by the Bangladeshi, which prompt him to seek protection as a practical agent, are two states of mind with two different directions in their relation to the world. To have felt vulnerable is to have perceived the threat and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
Desires, reconfigured in this way as relating in such a bidirectional form<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup> to desirabilities and undesirabilities in the world (i.e., relating to a world described in evaluative terms—threats, cruelties, needs), are just one central case of mental states of this kind. Emotions too, by and large, are to be conceived in just these terms. And once they are, a common and longstanding misconception about their place in practical human agency stands corrected. These points can do with some elaboration.
</p>

<p>
Too often, emotions are thought of as gumming up the works of deliberation in practical life, and in politics and morals in particular. Practical reason or rationality is frequently described almost entirely in deliberative terms of rational inference, and emotions are seen by contrast as conflicting with and spoiling the deliverances of reason, so conceived.<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup> Though that may happen sometimes, that occasional fact about them cannot plausibly be built into characterizing the nature of emotions. Seeing emotions along the lines I present below—as of a piece with the conception of desires presented above— helps to show why that is not so.
</p>

<p>
In this reconceptualization, emotions, like desires, are a mode of perception too. How so? Perhaps a good way to begin to convey this is to look at what such a reconceptualization would look like in the case of physical pain. A plausible conception of pain might go this way. Consider a toothache. We can perceive our teeth in the standard ways. I can put my forefinger to my tooth and perceive it tactually. I can go to a mirror, unfurl my lip, and perceive my tooth visually. But I can also, more internally, more involuntarily, perceive my tooth—and here we run out of the right “logical grammar,” to use Wittgenstein’s term—by paining from it. A toothache, thus, is a way of perceiving my tooth, and pains generally are internal modes of perception of parts of one’s body. Emotions too are modes of perception of this kind, though not of one’s body.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup> What, then, are they modes of perception of?
</p>

<p>
Aristotle<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup> writes of anger (“rage,” is actually the right translation of his particular example) in more than one place and says that it relates to belief as follows. If I am angry with a person, that <i>presupposes</i> a certain sort of belief, for instance, the belief that that person has done me harm. But this does not quite capture the right relation between belief and anger. To show why, I have deliberately emphasized “presupposes.” That is often the wrong relationship between emotions and a belief about the world. The relationship of presupposition here would suggest that the belief is <i>all in place first</i> and <i>then</i> the anger wells up. But that does not always capture the phenomenology of anger and indeed perhaps it only seldom captures it. Often, my anger is a way of <i>perceiving</i> that someone has done me harm. It’s not as if the belief is all calmly acquired and gives rise to the anger on reflection (not that this does not sometimes happen). My anger is my conduit to, a perception of, the fact that someone has done me harm. The perception of something (value-laden) in the world and the emotion are not separable, just as I was suggesting about desire and the perception of the value-laden world. Thus, perception of value-laden properties in the world and desire or emotion are not two cleanly separable states of mind.
</p>

<p>
If this is right, if emotions are ways of perceiving and forming perceptual beliefs about the world, then it cannot possibly be right to say that emotions gum up the works of rationality. In fact, far from gumming up the works, they <i>are</i> the works. The beliefs that go into rationality are often the deliverances of emotions, conceived in this way as modes of perception. (I should caution here that this point is not just the point that emotions have a propositional content—what is sometimes called the cognitive account of emotions. The point is not that emotions have the same form as beliefs, a propositional form; the point is that they are a path, a perceptual path to belief formation.) And, as the previous paragraph makes clear, this conception of emotions cannot even be formulated if one did not view the world as containing value properties. But once one views the world that way, such a conception of emotions is entirely and naturally of a piece with that view, as is the conception of desires presented above.
</p>

<p>
Desires (and emotions), I have said, are modes of perception of the value properties of the world, and <i>in being so</i>, they are <i>intrinsically</i> therefore capable of motivating our practical agency. They do the double duty of taking in the world in its aspect of value even as they, thereby, motivate our agency to action. Now, if they are perceptual in this way, they can, of course, sometimes get the world (in its value aspect) wrong. But that is true of all perception. There can be value-illusions just like there can be illusions, in general, about the nonvalue aspects of the world. This should cause neither surprise nor concern. What does seem to cause some concern is the fact that just as we can have value-illusions, we can have differential perception of value properties. The very fact of there being differential or conflicting perception of value properties in the world prompts the doubt that there really <i>are</i> such properties in the world. But that doubt is based on a non sequitur. For one thing, there is frequently differential perception of other properties in the world, the physical properties that natural sciences study—for instance, when we have internalized different physical theories about some physical phenomena in the world. This is just a familiar consequence of what is often described as “the theory-ladenness of observation.” But no one—no one sensible, anyway—is tempted to conclude from this that there are no physical properties in the world. In general, because it does not follow from the fact that there is some property in the world that there cannot be differential perception of it, equally it does not follow that if there is differential perception of the property that these are not really perceptions of a real property but rather a subjective derivation of it from our desires that is then “projected” onto the world in the way that Hume had suggested.
</p>

<p>
A related tendency that is also based on a confusion is to think that because values, by their very nature, are <i>intrinsically</i> related to the fact that we are practical agents who are responsive to them— a point essential to the argument of this paper—that intrinsic relation undermines them being real properties in the world such as the physical properties that are studied by the more detached methods of the natural sciences, which are supposed to have no such intrinsic or dependency relation to a responsive agency on our part. But it cannot be a plausible inference from the fact that we understand something (value) in the world as being related intrinsically to our capacity of agentive responsiveness to it that we must somehow be making up values all on our own and projecting them onto the world. For one thing, it is a familiar thought since Locke and Boyle at least, if not since Galileo, that color properties in the world are partly characterized in terms of <i>our</i> visual sensibilities (frogs, for instance, do not perceive color properties). But it is quite wrong to conclude from this (not that it has not been done) that the table on which my keyboard presently sits is not brown, nor any other color. I repeat that it is a non sequitur to go from the idea that something perceptible may require a certain sort of subject—one with our sort of practical agency, in the case of value, or one with our sort of visual sensibility, in the case of color <sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup>—to the idea that that thing does not exist in the world at all, that the subject somehow generates it from his own mentality and projects it on the world.
</p>

<p>
I will conclude with one final caveat about the nature of these visible value properties that the world (including nature) contains. In elaborating the link between them and our practical agency, I have said repeatedly that our perception of these properties takes the form of perception of the <i>normative demands</i> they make on us and to which our practical agency responds. Now, the expression “normative demand” is, of course, a <i>metaphor</i>. It is <i>not literally</i> a normative demand made by visible features of the world. In insisting on this point, I am declaring that, in subscribing to the view that there are value properties in the world (including nature), I am not subscribing to any sort of intentional vitalism that attributes intentionality to nature and the world. And by saying this, I am shunning the flamboyance of the sort of position taken by Bruno Latour and Jane Bennett and others who think there is some quite literal form of “actants” (I assume that by this term they have made current they mean <i>agents</i> of a kind broader than human agents) that populate nature and the world we inhabit, agents that literally address us with normative demands. My claim that there are value properties in the world is a much more innocuous claim than this. I am only saying that there are value properties in the world (including nature) and I am happily admitting that the idea that they make normative demands on us is a metaphor. No doubt this will seem like a cop-out to those who think we need a bolder commitment to vitalism.<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
But it is nothing of the sort. In fact, a proper (by which I mean sober) understanding of the nature of value shows such a vitalism to be quite unnecessary for the important issues at stake. Why do I rest with the thought that the expression “normative demands” is a metaphor? Why am I not moved by the doubt that the force of a normative demand is lost if the expression “normative demand” in these uses of it (unlike, say, when we use it to say that I, a human subject, make a normative demand of you) is not literal but metaphorical? Surprising as this may sound, the answer is that I am not moved by this doubt because of the <i>nature of metaphor</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is widely (and surely rightly) said of metaphors that they, at least the good and apt ones, are not paraphrasable into literal statements. This, as just stated, is (and is intended to be) a claim about the nature of (metaphorical) language. But it cannot just be a thesis about language. Though true as a thesis about language, its significance would be limited if it were just a claim in linguistics or the philosophy of language. Its full significance is only on view if we notice that its truth has a counterpart in a metaphysical thesis, an extralinguistic claim. What is that counterpart metaphysical claim to match the claim of unparaphrasability in linguistics or the philosophy of language? It is this: if a metaphor is not paraphrasable into literal statements or propositions, what that very thesis shows is that there is a fragment or aspect of <i>reality</i> that cannot be captured by any expression but <i>that</i> metaphor. It is striking that philosophers who have made the linguistic claim don’t make this metaphysical counterpart claim explicit.<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup> But once made explicit, it becomes clear that there is no loss of force in saying that value properties make normative demands on us, just because the expression “normative demands,” in its saying, is metaphorical. Without any commitment to intentional vitalism, a commitment generated by insisting on some sort of literal deployment of the expression “normative demands,” one has said what needs to be said: value properties in the world, including nature, are visible properties that make normative demands on us and prompt our engagement with the world, prompt our practical agency to action. A superstition of modernity that has long denied this presence of value in the perceptible world we inhabit is thereby laid to rest without any overreaching into an implausible and unnecessary vitalism.
</p>

<p>
Latour and his followers have insisted on an important point: there had better be a <i>politics of things</i> if we are to emerge with some sanity, indeed with some humanity (paradoxical as that may sound), from our destructively human-centered conception of politics (and political economy). This paper, though it has had nothing to say about what such a politics would look like, has tried to do the philosophical ground-clearing for it by providing a meta-ethical foundation for a politics of things. And it has done so without the gratuitous ontology of the <i>intentionality of things</i>.
</p>

<p>
The broad theme of the volume to which this paper is a contribution is “Invisibility.” Often the interest in that theme lies in the fact that things are below the surface of visibility and need to be unearthed. Sometimes, however—as in the theme of this paper— <i>things</i> that are on the surface and plainly visible to us are denied that visibility due to one or other distortion of our ways of “being in the world,” which philosophers first perpetrate but which then, through the exercise of the interest of more worldly forces, gets dispersed into the zeitgeist as a pervasive assumption of our time. It is that assumption that I have called a superstition of modernity and tried to philosophically exorcise. But a philosophical exorcism of the particular superstition that I have focused on in this paper, even if successful, would be an arcane achievement if one did not also see through to the details of a democratic conception of politics that included a “politics of things,” a politics on which we do not have even a preliminary grip, leave alone a sense of its details. But this should not surprise us, considering the long centuries it took for human beings to develop the details of a democratic politics that included every human being.

This second step flows in part from a qualification of the scientistic
superstition about nature that generates the first step, and this qualification leads to the emergence of a specific scientistic conception of the behavioral and social sciences, which then becomes a rationalization for the second step. In all this, values remain, as before in the first step, derivable from our desires, but now nature is permitted to contain a very specific kind of property that falls outside the purview of natural science and that the behavioral and social sciences broadly identify as “opportunities” (in the world, including nature) to satisfy those desires. In other words, since natural science does not study “opportunities” in nature, that slack is now picked up by the behavioral and social sciences, which are frameworked by the assumption that these opportunities are perceived (probabilistically) as properties that will satisfy the desires or subjective utilities that are the underlying basis of our values. Once nature is permitted opportunities, understood in this sense, the second step of the transformation of nature into natural resources has its broad rationalization. For more on this second step, see chapter 5 of Bilgrami 2014a.

A third element in the alliances formed were the commercial and mercantile interests of the period who were anxious that nature, conceived as sacralized, would present a theological obstacle to taking from nature with impunity. This element of the alliance became essential to achieving the second step (of the transformation of the concept of nature to the concept of natural resources) that I spoke of briefly in note 1. For a fine account of these alliances formed and the motivations for them, as well as the opposition to them in the “Radical Enlightenment,” see Margaret Jacob’s numerous writings on the political and social implications of “Newtonianism.”

I don’t deny that in the seventeenth century, when these proclamations were first explicitly made, the distinction between science and philosophy (or metaphysics) was not as clearly made as we would make it now—which is why I’ve restricted myself to mentioning Dawkins. But even then, it was clear that a distinction existed that was an antecedent to the present-day distinction between science and philosophy. Even then it was clear, for instance, that the debate about whether God was present in nature or a <i>deus absconditus</i> with a remote, providential status was a debate that was <i>quite independent of the truth or falsity of Newton’s laws</i>. Indeed, critics of Newtonianism, such as John Toland, never disputed Newton’s laws, they merely protested the exile of God from what was, until then, considered sacralized matter and nature. Thus both conceptions of God (immanent or distant and providential) were compatible with the science articulated in the laws. And this distinction between the scientific laws and the metaphysical status of God is what I am saying is the antecedent to the distinction we would currently draw between science and philosophy (or metaphysics).

I should, however, say by way of caution that, though I have used such a contrasting vocabulary to make the distinction vivid, the distinction between the two perspectives is not linguistic but philosophical. Someone who has thoroughly internalized the link between a certain scientific description of the world (“daily average caloric counts,” etc.) and a person’s need may, without turning to the vocabulary of needs in how he conceives the person, be prompted to practical agency. The point is not that one keeps changing one’s vocabulary or concepts as one moves from detachment to engagement or vice versa. The point is only that detachment and engagement are two distinct perspectives <i>on the world</i> (as well as on oneself) and the world must contain properties over and above what natural science studies in order for us to have the latter perspective on it. That we always are using or thinking in the evaluative <i>vocabulary</i> when we perceive the value properties in the world is not what is essential. The distinction is not intended as a linguistic distinction but a philosophical one. Contrasting vocabularies are just an easy way to convey the philosophical distinction, but should not be seen as essential to the distinction.

By “consider x” I mean either observe x if it is available in our vicinity and consider whether it is desirable, or if it is not available for perception we may imagine its desirability—and I am assuming that imagination in these cases, as in all cases, depends on some background of previous perceptions of x or other things and properties like or approximating x.

The self-standing view of desires (that the challenge assumes is sufficient for agency) is something that is not just maintained by the Humean tradition I have mentioned in presenting the superstition of our modern period. It is maintained, perhaps with a more self-consciously rich texture of concepts than the Humeans deploy, by the entire Verstehen tradition in European thought as well. This tradition insists on the irreducibility of the study of human behavior to the methods and concepts of the natural sciences, stressing the interpretative dimension that characterizes human mentality (this is the richness that it perhaps adds to the Humean tradition), missing in the subject matter of the natural sciences. But there is nothing in this tradition that requires a <i>“re-enchantment”</i> of the world by value properties (not even the highly revisionary, secular notion of enchantment I have proposed, which has no basis in religion or magic). In this tradition, we (human subjects) are enchanted, but the enchantment is within us—and within the behavior made possible by what is within us, by our mentality. But if I am right to resist the superstition I am resisting, this is a shallow understanding of the human subject. There can be no such enchantment of the human subject if the world the human subject inhabits is not also enchanted in the sense that is denied by the superstition.

This denial of agency can be seen, as I have been saying, to be a totalization of the perspective found in (2). If all we had was that perspective, there would be no practical agency. There can also be a totalization of (1), and Sartre in much of his early work comes close to such a totalization, claiming that statements of the form (2) amount to bad faith, really expressing (1) in a disguised and deceptive form. It was because of this totalization that Sartre, famously, developed his hostility to psychoanalysis.

This is sometimes described by the phrase “different directions of fit” that beliefs and desires possess. See the next note for a neologism in the terminology to express the denial of this idea.

To express the denial of different directions of fit for beliefs and desire, the philosopher J. E. J. Altham (1986) coined the neologism “besires” for states that have both directions of fit at once.

Spinoza, motivated by the detail of his own metaphysics, did think of them as being just that. See Damasio 2004 for a contemporary updating of this view. The view presented here, motivated not by a metaphysics so much as an account of value and agency (and the intrinsically linked relationship between them), is quite different.

See De Anima 1.1.403a16–32 and The Rhetoric 2.2.1378a31. I don’t pretend that this is exactly the interpretation of what he says Aristotle intended. Even if he did not, the point is intuitively plausible to many, at least as a first thought about the relationship between emotions and beliefs—and I want to come to the right picture by finding fault in this intuitive first thought.

The analogy between color and value is imperfect and should not be taken further than where I have rested with it. There are, for instance, disanalogies too, since color may quite properly be thought to be dependent in some way (“supervenient,” as philosophers say) on the properties studied by fundamental physics, whereas it is not obvious that it makes sense to think that values are similarly dependent on these.

Thus, for instance, Donald Davidson (1978), who makes this claim more vividly than the many others who have made it, fails to mention the metaphysical significance of the claim. He presents it merely as a claim in the philosophy of language.
